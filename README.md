# Financial-System

## Project Overview 

The project buils on a powerful financial dtabase system. It stimulates a banking application with the following components: 
  1. **Customers** and their identities
  2. **Accounts** e.g. savings/ personal linked to customers
  3. **Transactions** involving money flow in and out of accounts
  4. **Loans** issued to customers with interest and timelines

The goal is to enable complex data analysis using SQL to derive financial insights about customer behaviour, account activity, and loan management.
